## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Privacy First**: Your answers remain completely private. The app is 100% client-side, and no data is ever sent to a server or stored in any database.
*   **Guided Prompts**: Explore dozens of thoughtfully designed categories, each with focused questions inspired by established psychological principles (CBT, Positive Psychology, etc.).
*   **Emotional Categorization**: Quickly find relevant prompts by browsing high-level classes like *Emotional Well-being*, *Personal Growth*, and *Relationships*.
*   **Beautiful & Minimalist UI**: A clean, calming interface with subtle animations to help you focus on your thoughts.
*   **Frictionless Experience**: No login, no signup. Just open the page and start reflecting.
*   **Instant & Ephemeral**: Designed for in-the-moment reflection. Once you complete a session, your answers are gone, encouraging you to focus on the process, not the record.

## üí° Project Philosophy

The core idea behind Momentary Journal is to provide a safe, private space for reflection without the pressure of creating a permanent archive. It's about the *act* of thinking and writing, not the artifact. By being ephemeral, it encourages honest, in-the-moment introspection.
